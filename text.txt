    Crime is a social problem that disturbs the peace and tranquillity of society. It can be 
inferred from the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) data that urban areas, particularly 
metropolitan cities, are more prone to crime in comparison to their rural counterparts. As 
per the 2011 census, about 13% population of the country is residing in metropolitan 
cities while their contribution to total crime incidents was about 28% in 2015. Apositive 
correlation (+0.69) between city size and the crime rate is also recorded during the 
reference year. Fifty-three metropolitan cities reported in the 2011 census are facing a 
differential rate of crime. National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) publishes year-wise data of 
crime in India, which also contain data of all metropolitan cities. Based on NCRB data, the 
incidents and rate of IPC crimes, violent crimes, and the crime against women in metropolitan 
cities are analyzed in the study. It is found that metropolitan cities of northern and central 
India having a higher rate of crime in comparison to other cities. The nature of crime also 
varies considerably in these cities as incidents of violent crime and crime against 
women are disproportionately high in the cities of Hindi speaking states. Many relatively 
small metropolitan cities have a comparatively higher rate of IPC crimes, violent crimes, 
and crimes against women. The impact of metropolitan cities on the total crime of their 
respective states has been analyzed, and it is evident that in many states, particularly 
central Indian states, crime is highly concentrated in metropolitan cities.
